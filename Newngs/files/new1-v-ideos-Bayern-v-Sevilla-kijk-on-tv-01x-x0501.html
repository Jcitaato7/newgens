How to watch LA-Lafayette vs Georgia State: TV channel, NCAAF live stream info, start time, score

Considering their sizeable disadvantage in the spread, the Georgia State Panthers can expect to have a real challenge on their hands on Saturday. They will face off against the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns at noon ET at Parker H. Petit Field at Georgia State Stadium. While the Panthers were not exactly top dog last year, they did wrap up the year with a winning record of 7-6. Louisiana was 11-3 last season and is coming off of a 31-14 win against the Iowa State Cyclones on Saturday.

Two last-season defensive stats to keep in the back of your head while watching: Georgia State was fourth worst when it came to touchdowns allowed last year, with the squad giving up 60 overall. To make matters even worse for Georgia State, Louisiana was fifth best in the nation in passing touchdowns allowed, finishing the 2019 season giving up only 11.

The SEC will be back next week, while the Big Ten is aiming for a return on the weekend of Oct. 24. The Big 12 had a pair of teams scheduled to play this weekend, but is now down to just Oklahoma State taking on Tulsa (+23) after Baylor's matchup against Houston was cancelled due to concerns surrounding COVID-19. That leaves much of the attention for the Week 3 college football schedule centered on the ACC. 

The latest Week 3 college football odds from William Hill list Duke as a six-point favorite against Boston College. Louisville is laying 2.5 points against Miami (FL), while NC State has a slight one-point edge against Wake Forest, according to the latest college football spreads. Before making any Week 3 college football picks on those games or others, be sure to see the latest college football predictions from SportsLine's proven model.
